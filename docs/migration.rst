#. Remove all celery related settings from your project.
#. Provision infra required for taskhawk using taskhawk_terraform_ and taskhawk_terraform_generator_, or manually.
#. Add new processes for workers on each priority queue that your app publishes to (not all queues may be relevant
   for your app).
#. Deploy Taskhawk worker processes (not publishers).
#. Verify that Taskhawk workers pick up message by sending a test message.
#. Deploy publisher processes.
#. Let Celery queues drain to 0.
#. Terminate Celery worker processes.

If Celery workers also publish async tasks:

#. Add new processes for workers on each priority queue that your app publishes to (not all queues may be relevant
   for your app).
#. Deploy a test TaskHawk worker process.
#. Verify that Taskhawk workers pick up message by sending a test message.
#. Double publish to both Taskhawk and Celery in Celery workers.
